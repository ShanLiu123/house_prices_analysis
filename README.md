background
This project aims to use machine learning technology to build a housing price prediction model to help people better understand and predict the trend of the real estate market. 
Housing prices are an important economic indicator that is important for home buyers, developers, and government decision-makers. By analyzing various characteristics of the house, such as area, location, number of rooms, etc., we can build a predictive model to estimate the house price, thus providing a decision-making reference for the relevant parties.

Dataset contents
The dataset we use contains a range of characteristics of the house and the corresponding price data. 
characteristics in the dataset include, but are not limited to, the size of the house, the geographical location, the number of rooms,
the distance to the nearby subway, etc. House prices are used as the target variable, and we will use other characteristics in the dataset to predict it.

Code Intent
The code of this project is mainly divided into the following parts:

Data loading and preprocessing: including data reading, missing value processing, feature engineering, etc.
Data visualization: Exploratory analysis of data through visualization helps us better understand data characteristics and distribution.
Model construction: LightGBM and neural networks are used to build housing price prediction models, and the models are evaluated and compared.
Result display: Generate visual charts to display the prediction effect and analysis results of the model.
